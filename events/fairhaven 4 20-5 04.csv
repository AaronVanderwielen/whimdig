Science fiction and fantasy can be a great escape, but it can also be a great way to examine social issues and alternative viewpoints or identities. Historically, science fiction has often been used as a way of commenting on the biases of the age in which it is written, using metaphors such as the creation of robots, alternative relationships between alien species, and the colonization of other worlds to show contemporary problems or questions in a new light. This group meets the third Monday of every month at 7pm in the writing corner on the mezzanine level of Village Books.",4/20/2015 7:00pm,4/20/2015 8:00pm,start,55352fda846af9640a518a0b,

The magnitude of the change in America's relationship to marijuana can't be measured in only economic or social terms: There are deeper shifts going on - cultural realignments, social adjustments, and financial adjustments. The place of marijuana in our lives is being rethought, reconsidered, and recalibrated. In 2012, Bruce Barcott reluctantly voted for legalization in his home state of Washington; the next morning he wondered, “What have we done?” Weed the People addresses the booming pot industry and looks at the legal, social, cultural, and personal changes brought about by the changing status of the world’s most controversial plant.<br />Bruce Barcott, author of The Last Flight of the Scarlet Macaw and The Measure of a Mountain: Beauty and Terror on Mount Rainier, is a contributing editor at Outside magazine.

55354516e9c358700bd52317,Village Books,Robert Arthur Stayton - Power Shift,"Power Shift, by Robert Arthur Stayton, describes the fundamental changes in the human relationship with energy. For two hundred years human society has mined caches of fossil energy to build and run a  mechanized civilization. With the limits of fossil fuels in sight because of their unintended consequences—climate change and ocean acidification--the next step is not to dig up a new energy source, says the author, but instead to tap into the vast dynamic power sources that flow all around us, sources that derive their power from the sun. Written for a general audience, Power Shift explains this insight by retelling the story of humans in terms of energy, and it outlines the current energy dilemma, and a way forward. Bill McKibben, author of Earth and Oil and Honey, says “Solar is surging all of a sudden, and if you read this comprehensive book you’ll understand why!” Robert Arthur Stayton lives in Santa Cruz County, California. He has a Masters Degree in Physics and has taught college courses in physics, energy, and solar energy. He completed the Graduate Program in Science Communication at UC Santa Cruz, and has had articles published in Popular Science and Science Notes. In 1997, Stayton and his wife built a passive solar home in Santa Cruz County and outfitted it with an off-grid solar photovoltaic system. He has been living with solar energy since then, always looking for new ways to apply solar in his daily life. He drives a solar-charged Plug-in Prius, heats his water with a solar water heating system, and bakes his bread in his solar oven. He has served as host to hundreds of people who have toured his home to see his solar efforts.",4/24/2015 7:00pm,4/24/2015 8:00pm,start,55352fda846af9640a518a0b,
