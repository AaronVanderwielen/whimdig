55355e77cb92046b0facf29b,Wild Buffalo,90's Night! ft. Boombox Kid,"90's Night is at the Wild Buffalo is much more than just your standard dance party at a night club. It is a MOVEMENT. It's a movement to our nostalgic past, it's a movement of change, and it's a movement of our bodies in the happiest way possible. 90's Night is now EVERY WEDNESDAY night at the Wild Buffalo and it brought to you by Boombox Kid, ""the best and most entertaining DJ in Bellingham."" This movement is happening because we couldn't ignore your requests to make this a weekly event any longer.<br /><br />The most appropriate tagline that we can give 90's night is, ""Everything from Weezer to Wutang."" When it comes to the 90's, there was too much good music to pick just one genre. Dr. Dre, Backstreet Boys, Nirvana, Spice Girls, Green Day, Wu-Tang, Britney Spears, DMX, all of the one-hit-wonders, and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Come out early to avoid the line, enjoy our great drink specials (listed below), and experience Bellingham's best weekly dance party! <br /><br />Drink Specials: <br /> <br />$2 Wells before 10pm <br />$3 Wells before 11pm <br />$2 Old German Tall Boys all night <br /><br />90's Night at the Wild Buffalo is only $2 unless you are a student with I.D. which means it's 100% FREE!",4/22/2015 9:30pm,4/23/2015 1:30am,end,"55352fda846af9640a518a04,55352fda846af9640a518a05",weekly
